Bhatkal resident Ismail Abdul Rauf’s interrogation has given leads to investigators on missing links that could be a part of the large puzzle, including the alleged Islamic State (IS) fighter Shafi Armar alias Yousuf al Hindi, and how he purportedly funded to raise an Indian affiliated jihadi group through Dubai.Known as the centre of money laundering or hawala operations, Dubai, along with other countries in the Gulf region, houses a large Indian diaspora. Importantly, various armed groups, including the IS, in the ongoing conflict in Syria are funded through a network of private donations, collected from sheikhs, tribal leaders, influential ulemas and Arab diaspora based in Gulf countries. These two factors could be a starting point in unraveling the funding of Junood al Khalifa e Hind group outside the Indian territory by the Indians living in Gulf.Rauf had earlier travelled to Dubai 10 months ago to work as a labourer and came into contact with another Bhatkal resident, Ismail Nanda. During the time of their acquaintance, Nanda asked Rauf if he knew any hawala operators in Dubai and the latter gave contact of an operator, Abdullah Umaid. Officials investigating the case said Rauf was later contacted by Nanda and asked to check if Nadeem (code name for Sheikh’s hawala transaction) got the money. Rauf did not know who Mudabbir Sheikh was but it is believed that Nanda used the hawala operator in Dubai, suggested by Rauf, to make the transaction. Rauf was earlier a suspect in the case, but National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now made him a witness and is verifying the information provided by him. The agency is also making use of the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) with Dubai to dig deep into Nanda s identity and find if he facilitated the hawala transactions to India at the behest of al Hindi or any other IS leader. If substantiated, it will take the investigation closer to proving that al Hindi used the IS group’s funds collected illegally by smuggling and selling oil, antiquities, collecting taxes from population living in its territory, ransom and selling Yezidi women as slaves among other methods to raise a module in India.",['Not categorized'],['NotSpecified'],['Unknown ']

The extremists took three workers at gunpoint and then beat them up badly. They warned them against working on the project and set four vehicles on fire. The suspected extremists left behind a pamphlet, wherein one Amit ji claimed responsibility for the attack, and disappeared into Keredari forests. Local sources said of late, Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist) cadres and their breakaway factions had been on the back foot in the face of sustained Police patrol in the area. There hadn t been any big crime here in recent past, they claimed. So, the raid was basically a handiwork of a local gang, which wanted to terrorise the agency officials in the garb of a new rebel outfit. Hazaribagh, Superintendent of Police (SP), Bhimsen Tuti visited the spot to take stock of the situation and spoke to the workers. Preliminary probe hints at involvement of a criminal gang, and police have identified some of its members. Raids are on and all of them will be arrested soon, the SP added.","['Private Citizens and Property', 'Private Citizens and Property']","['thrashed', 'ablaze']","['Left Wing Extremists (LEW)', 'Naxalites']"

He said he wanted to draw the attention to a dangerous situation that could be risen by hiding the facts and decided to disclose the facts regarding the IS rebels. Justifying his statement the Justice Minister said the even the international media in foreign countries publish the information related to individuals joining the IS in order to suppress the terrorist acts. However, some websites are publishing false news reports and causing damage to the independence of the country s judiciary as well eroding the confidence of the public in the judicial system, the Minister pointed out. The Justice Minister charged that a small number of journalists are using the situation to spread false news reports and create a media mafia. The Minister had informed the Parliament on November 18 that 32 well educated Sri Lankan Muslims of four families have joined the IS in Syria.Earlier, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka (MCSL) had strongly objected to the statement made by the Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in Parliament regarding the Muslim community.

There have been no new reports of any others involved since this was reported last year, he pointed out. It is believed that one family had gone to Syria to provide humanitarian support to the war wounded and refugees. Some of the men are alleged to have joined or forced to join the fighting forces of ISIS. The Muslim community, including the Muslim Council, Jamiathul Ulema and other organizations cooperated with the government in identifying the families to provide the necessary support for the intelligence agencies to investigate. Those who have gone to Syria as quoted by Hon. Rajapakshe include women and children. he said. Ameen said the Minister s statement comes at a very opportune time to certain extremist elements bent on tarnishing the image of the Muslim community for reasons only best known to them. The Muslim community is seriously alarmed about the re emergence of the racist campaign that was carried out by extremist Buddhist monks since the end of the war in 2009. Many youth too have started social media campaigns against the Muslim community. The statements made by the Hon Minster would only help to disturb peace and promote the interests of certain vested interests to destroy our country.

In his book ‘Choices Inside the Making of India’s Foreign Policy’, Menon says that this estimate does not include the “opportunity cost” to Sri Lanka which was once the fastest growing and the most open economy in South Asia. About deaths, the veteran Indian diplomat turned security expert says that between 1983 and 2009, 80,000 to 100,000 people, including combatants from both sides, lost their lives. Among them were 30,000 to 50,000 civilians, 27,693 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) cadres, 23,790 Sri Lankan Army personnel, and 1,155 men of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF).The final stages of the war had created a little over 300,000 refugees or Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). The war had also left 1.6 million land mines in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. But the real casualty of the war was Sri Lanka’s composite society, something that the LTTE and Sinhala chauvinism are “equally responsible for”, Menon says. “Sri Lanka’s democracy was flawed by disappearances, killings, torture, detention, and widespread human rights abuses committed by all sides in the war. Civil military relations were skewed, Sinhala society was militarized, and the brutalized remnants of Tamil civil society were leaderless, without direction or hope. Nor was there any sign of an attempt to come to terms with the legacy and result of the war, to undertake real reconciliation,” he observes grimly.

Experts cautioned that the declining number didn’t mean New Delhi has become less vulnerable to attacks, especially from Pakistan based militant outfits such the Jaish e Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar e Taiba (LeT). The Jaish and Lashkar enjoy patronage from the Pakistani establishment and army, and are involved in this year’s Pathankot air base and Uri army camp attacks in which about two dozen Indian soldiers were killed. Pakistan denies the charge.The Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Research and Analysis Wing (R AW) alerted Delhi Police 306 times about possible terrorist attacks since 2012, which recorded the highest number of warnings at 77. In comparison, only 29 alerts have surfaced till September, 2016 a Delhi Police response to a right to information query revealed. “Broadly, we can divide these inputs into two parts. One is of general nature. Say possibilities of attack during Independence Day and Republic Day. We circulate these inputs to keep our forces on the toes,” a senior Delhi police officer said. He added, “The second type is specific. For instance, X person is coming to Delhi and staying in a particular hotel. We investigate and report back to the agency about the authenticity of the alert. No information is available on the authenticity of each and every alert.”Another aspect attributed to the decreasing alerts is the growing presence of Islamic State (IS) and al Qaeda sympathizers, and home grown militants. Intelligence agencies don’t share alerts in such cases, but take action with the help of local Police. Delhi Police arrested about a dozen militants in 2016; among them six IS sympathisers and two are from the al Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). “None of them came directly from Pakistan. Agencies get information about Pakistan based terrorist through local informers and technical intervention such as call interception, including months of work such as data encryption as ISIS members interact through social media,” an officer said. Such cases go beyond the realm of alert, but invite actionable input that requires direct collaboration between the intelligence agency and police to arrest the militant. “That explains why number of terrorism related alerts is going down, though IS members are getting arrested increasingly,” the officer said.",['Not categorized'],['NotSpecified'],['Unknown ']

Good terrorists are the ones that attack your neighbours; bad terrorists are the ones who attack you. This type of approach is enormously short sighted. The blowback is going to be bad. Terrorism will bite like a snake whoever feeds it, he added. Terrorism will bite probably like a snake. States need to have a common perspective, he warned. Ghani also said the threat of terrorism is not a passing threat, and that terrorist organisations change very rapidly, even if their objectives remain the same.He also categorically hit out at those using religion to justify terrorist acts, saying Islam does not condone terrorism. A tiny minority cannot be allowed to hijack a civilization and a religion. There is no terrorism in the past 160 years except for adherence, practitioners from every civilization that we take. So, there is no reason to demonize a certain civilization. But on the other hand, members of that community have an obligation to speak truth to violence, Ghani said. It is unacceptable to speak in the name of Islam. Islam does not allow for terrorism. Terrorism must be condemned and we must stand together to contain it. Extremism cannot be permitted a platform. This is denial of everything that we stand for, and everything that civilization has stood for, he added.He also stressed that Afghanistan does not allow terrorists to launch attacks from its soil, despite the fact that it is under attack.Ghani said that south Asia is reeling under two wars — one in Afghanistan which is not a civil war and the other in Pakistan. However, he said, the war in Pakistan is not being covered adequately by the media. Around 2,700 (Pakistani) forces moved to the north western province and also Balochistan; this violence needs to be covered (by media) as people need to talk about it to address it, Ghani said while answering questions. However, to a specific question on whether he would support the independence movement in Balochistan, he said his country and his government do not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. We respect international norms, Ghani said even as he maintained that if people in these regions are not happy, there is a constitutional framework within Pakistan and that should be able to address the issue. However, in a veiled attack on Pakistan s use of force, he said Forces do not keep people together, rights and connectivity do.
